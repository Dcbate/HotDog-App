# Dog Walking Weather App üå§Ô∏èüêï

This app tells you if it's safe to walk your dog based on the weather and temperature in your location. It uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch real-time weather data and provides a visual cue with animations of either a walking dog or a dog drinking water.

## Features
- üå°Ô∏è Displays the current temperature.
- üêï Shows a walking dog animation if the weather is safe for walking.
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Shows a "too hot" animation if the temperature is too high for safe walking.
- Uses **Core Location** to get the user's location.
- Retrieves weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- **Lottie** for animations.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-ios-app.git
    ```

2. Open the project in **Xcode**.

3. Install any dependencies (such as **Lottie**) via **Swift Package Manager**:
    - Go to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`.
    - Add the **Lottie** package: `https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios`.

4. Obtain an API key from **OpenWeatherMap**:

      ```swift
      let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
      ```

## Usage
